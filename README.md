## Name
Face detect with firebase.

## Description
This app detects a face from a photo taken through the device's camera (cell phone, tablet, etc), as well as generates an embedding of the captured photo using the Facenet network.


## Setting DEV machine
  - Android Studio/Visual Studio Code
  - Linux Ubuntu 18.04

## Flutter Setup
  - Flutter 2.9.0-0.1.pre â€¢ channel beta
  - Dart 2.16.0 (build 2.16.0-80.1.beta)

## Firebase Setup
To configure firebase in a project, just go to the [firebase consoles](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/), login with your google account and then you can add your app to the firebase.

Just create a project and then add your app informing the package name. The next steps are explained after the app is added to firebase.

## Note
The simulation can be performed in a cell phone virtualization or using a physical cell phone plugged into the serial.

Firebase is already configured for this app.
